# Getting Started

## Installation

To use `ChatOps4s` with Discord, install the following dependency

<SbtDependency moduleName={"chatops4s-discord"} />

## Picking an `sttp` Backend

You must install an `sttp` backend which `ChatOps4s` will use to make HTTP requests on your behalf. View your choices of backends on `sttp`'s [documentation](https://sttp.softwaremill.com/en/latest/backends/summary.html).

## Picking a `tapir` Server Interpreter

You must install a `tapir` server interpreter to allow `ChatOps4s` to receive HTTP requests from Discord. View your choices of server interpreters on `tapir`'s [documentation](https://tapir.softwaremill.com/en/latest/server/overview.html).

## Setting up your Server

Once you have picked a server interpreter and `sttp` backend, import the `Server` and `DiscordInbound` class to set up your sever. In the following example, we create a `ChatOps4s` server using the `http4s` interpreter (using `blaze`) and `cats` backend for `sttp`:

```scala

```
