# Sending a Reply

You can use the `DiscordOutbound` trait to send a reply. This is especially useful when registering an action, where `messageId` is available in the `InteractionContext`.

## Example

<SbtDependency moduleName={"chatops4s-discord"} />

```scala

```

Now, when the Accept button is clicked, `ChatOps4s` will reply to the message where the interaction occurred with "You Accepted!". Similarly, if the Decline button is clicked, it will reply with "You Declined!".
