# Send to Thread

You can use the `DiscordOutbound` trait to send a message to a thread. This is especially useful when registering an action, where `channelId` is available in the `InteractionContext`.

## Example

<SbtDependency moduleName={"chatops4s-discord"} />

```scala file=./main/scala/discord/docs/SendToThread.scala start=start_doc end=end_doc
```

Now, when the Accept button is clicked, `ChatOps4s` will send a "Someone Accepted!" message to the "Accepts Thread" thread in the same channel. Similarly, if the Decline button is clicked, it will send a "Someone Declined!" message to the "Declines Thread".
